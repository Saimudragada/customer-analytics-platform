## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Customer Segmentation Analysis (RFM)

Segmented 93,358 customers into 8 distinct behavioral groups using Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis:

| Segment | Count | Avg CLV | Churn % | Action Priority |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Champions** | 6,248 | $312 | 12% | 🟢 Retain with VIP program |
| **At Risk** | 12,450 | $178 | 68% | 🔴 Urgent win-back campaigns |
| **Hibernating** | 9,877 | $124 | 91% | 🔴 Aggressive reactivation |
| **Recent** | 15,234 | $89 | 45% | 🟡 Onboarding optimization |

**Critical Finding:** "At Risk" segment (12,450 customers, $2.22M revenue) represents the highest ROI opportunity—these customers have proven purchase intent and are salvageable with intervention.

### 2️⃣ Churn Prediction Model

**XGBoost Classifier** with 41 engineered features

| Metric | Score | Business Meaning |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 96.2% | 96 out of 100 predictions correct |
| **Precision** | 94.5% | False alarm rate only 5.5% |
| **Recall** | 93.8% | Catches 94% of actual churners |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.96 | Excellent model discrimination |

**Top Predictors:**
1. **Recency (40%)** - Days since last order  
2. **Customer Age (30%)** - Account tenure  
3. **R Score (20%)** - RFM recency metric

**Deployment Strategy:** Weekly batch scoring → Auto-trigger retention workflows for customers >60% churn probability
